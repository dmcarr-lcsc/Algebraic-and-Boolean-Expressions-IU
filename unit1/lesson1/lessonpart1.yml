  ## Understanding Algebraic Expressions in Python


  Algebraic expressions are a fundamental part of mathematics and programming.
  In Python, you can use algebraic expressions to perform calculations and solve
  problems. Let's explore how to work with these expressions in Python.


  ### Basic Algebraic Operations


  In Python, you can perform basic algebraic operations using standard
  arithmetic operators:


  - **Addition (`+`)**: Adds two numbers.

  - **Subtraction (`-`)**: Subtracts one number from another.

  - **Multiplication (`*`)**: Multiplies two numbers.

  - **Division (`/`)**: Divides one number by another.

  - **Exponentiation (`**`)**: Raises a number to the power of another.


  ### Example


  Here's a simple example of an algebraic expression in Python:


  ```python

  # Calculate the expression: 3x^2 + 2x + 1

  x = 5

  result = 3 * (x ** 2) + 2 * x + 1

  print("The result of the expression is:", result)

  ```


  ### Interactive Exercise


  Try modifying the value of `x` in the code above and observe how the result
  changes. What happens if you set `x` to 0? What if you use a negative number?


  ### Practice Problem


  Write a Python function that calculates the value of the expression `4x^3 -
  3x^2 + 2x - 5` for any given value of `x`. Test your function with different
  values of `x` to ensure it works correctly.


  ```python

  def calculate_expression(x):
      # Your code here
      return 4 * (x ** 3) - 3 * (x ** 2) + 2 * x - 5

  # Test the function

  print(calculate_expression(2))  # Expected output: 21

  ```


  ### Reflection


  Consider how algebraic expressions can be used in real-world applications,
  such as calculating interest rates or modeling physical phenomena. How might
  understanding these expressions help you in other areas of computer science?


  ### Further Exploration


  For more practice, try creating your own algebraic expressions and writing
  Python code to evaluate them. Experiment with different operators and see how
  they affect the outcome.
